Changes in version 1.4:

The undo command has been fixed to restore the modified status of the
buffer being edited.

A race condition with user interrupt has been fixed in
search_and_replace.

The functions resize_line_buffer and resize_undo_buffer have been added
to definitively fix the aliasing warnings.

Some minor corrections have been made to the manual.
